# Django News PR Filter

A simple script that automates the first paragraph of the 'Updates to Django' section for https://django-news.com.

## Installation

1. This script uses the `gh` CLI to search and filter PRs. See [gh CLI installation instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).


2. After installing `gh` CLI, you'll have to authenticate with a GitHub host.

```bash
gh auth login
```

## Usage
Running `uv run main.py` without any args/kwargs will pull last week's (Monday until Sunday) merged PRs and will dump the output to an `OUT.md`.

Example `OUT.md`:
```md
Updates to Django
